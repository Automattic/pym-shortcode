# Pym Shortcode

Pym Shortcode will resize an iframe responsively depending on the height of its content and the width of its container. The plugin uses [Pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/), developed by the NPR Visuals Team, to allow embedded content in WordPress posts and pages using a simple shortcode. 

## Installation

1. Download the zip file from this Github repo and upload it manually to your WordPress site.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Nothing to configure, just begin using Pym Shortcode!

## Using Pym Shortcode

In a WordPress post or page use Pym Shortcode like this:

`[pym src="http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/examples/table/child.html"]`

Example in a post:

Desktop view of the WordPress post with the NPR embed using Pym Shortcode:

## Options

```
[pym src="" pymsrc="" pymoptions=""]
```

`src` is the URL of the page that is to be embedded.

`pymsrc` is optional; only set this if you need to specify a different source than the default. The default pym source is `js/pym.src` in this plugin.

`pymoptions` is optional; this should be a javascript object without the surrounding `{}`, and is given in the event that options need to be passed to the `pymParent`. NPR gives [this example](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/#examples) javascript:

```js
pym.Parent('example', 'child.html', { xdomain: '*\.npr\.org' });
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I want to use Pym in the first place?

Using iframes in a responsive page can be frustrating. It’s easy enough to make an iframe’s width span 100% of its container, but sizing its height is tricky — especially if the content of the iframe changes height depending on page width (for example, because of text wrapping or media queries) or events within the iframe.

### Why is a WordPress plugin needed to use Pym.js?

Normally WordPress strips out JavaScript inserted in posts and pages, so the native Pym.js code won't work. Pym Shortcode simply provides a wrapper around Pym.js so you can embed anything you'd use Pym.js for by using WordPress shortcode. 

### When would I use a Pym solution versus embed code without using Pym?

If you're embedding a YouTube video or a SoundCloud audio player, you don't need Pym.js and in fact you would not want to use it. To make these commodity types of embeds responsive, you may need to add CSS rules depending on your theme. Beyond that, Pym will just get in the way. 

You would want to use Pym for other types of iframe content including tables, charts, and interactive elements. For example, news organizations often create data-driven visualizations that are hosted in another application and need to be iframed into their CMS. Pym.js is built for that.

### Is Pym.js or this plugin dependent on jQuery or any other library?

Nope.

### How do you serve pym.js if the embedded page's domain has an SSL cert (and can/will be served over HTTPS) but the parent page's domain does not have an SSL certificate?

The default pym source is js/pym.src in this plugin which would be served by whatever protocol your site is using. But you can optionally change the source by using the `pymsrc` parameter in the shortcode, for example a CDN source for Pym.js like `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.min.js`

### How do you know if there's an HTTPS problem with a given embedded iframe?

- If the embed isn't resizing correctly (especially vertically), the pym.js script may not be loading correctly.
- You see if the embed is being served by https by opening the embed in new tab and looking at the protocol it's using.
