A WordPress solution to embed iframes that are responsive horizontally and vertically using the NPR Visuals Team's pym.js.

== Description ==

Pym Shortcode will resize an iframe responsively depending on the height of its content and the width of its container. The plugin uses [Pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/), developed by the NPR Visuals Team, to allow embedded content in WordPress posts and pages using a simple shortcode.

== Installation ==

1. In the WordPress Dashboard go to **Plugins**, then click the **Add Plugins** button and search the WordPress Plugins Directory for Pym Shortcode. Alternatively, you can download the zip file from this Github repo and upload it manually to your WordPress site.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Nothing to configure, just begin using Pym Shortcode!
